# Weather-Email
A program to send an email everyday to notify me of the weather and the probability of rain.
- Uses SMTP to send email
- Reports current time, minimum and maximum perceived temperatures, and probability of rain by hour
- Uses Open Meteo API

I wanted to add the pollen levels initiall, that was the objective of the project,but I could not find any free API that covered the pollen levels across Canada.
